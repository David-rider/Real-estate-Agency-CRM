/**
 * Release step: brings the database schema up to date before the API starts.
 *
 * - Databases originally created with `prisma db push` have tables but no
 *   migration history; the first migration is marked as applied (baseline)
 *   so the rest can run. Every later migration is idempotent.
 * - Later migrations left half-applied by an earlier failed deploy are marked
 *   rolled back and re-run (they are idempotent).
 * - Then `prisma migrate deploy` applies anything pending.
 *
 * Runs automatically on production start (see server.ts), or by hand:
 *   npm run release
